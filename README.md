# Smartwatch Sleep Tracking

## Overview
This repo contains pseudocode for a smartwatch sleep cycle detection algorithm. It mimics how devices like the Apple Watch or Oura Ring guess sleep stages (Awake, Light, Deep, REM) using proxy data—motion (accelerometer), heart rate, and HRV (PPG sensor). No brainwaves here, just educated guesses. Studies peg accuracy at 60-80% for sleep/wake, 50-75% for stages. It’s a toy, not a lab.


## How It Works
1. **Sleep Detection**  
   - Watches for low motion (`< 0.1`) and a heart rate drop (`5 bpm` below baseline).  
   - Why? Sleep = less movement, slower pulse. Crude but catches onset.

2. **Epoch Collection**  
   - Chops sleep into 30-sec chunks, logging motion, HR, and HRV.  
   - Why? Granular data for stage guesses without drowning in a full night.

3. **Stage Classification**  
   - Uses a hypothetical ML model or fallback heuristic:  
     - `Awake`: High motion  
     - `Deep`: Low HR, high HRV  
     - `REM`: Still, low HRV  
     - `Light`: Everything else  
   - Why? Models ape PSG patterns; heuristics are a cheap stand-in.

4. **Smoothing**  
   - Fixes jittery transitions (no 30-sec REM blips). Assumes ~90-min cycles.  
   - Why? Real sleep isn’t a pinball machine.

5. **Output**  
   - Tallies sleep time, stage percentages, and mocks up a chart.  
   - Why? Users love shiny stats, even if they’re shaky.

## Limitations
- No EEG = no precision. REM errors hit 20%+ vs. polysomnography.  
- Assumes a pre-trained model—training’s not here.  
- Simplified sensors; real devices might add temp or breathing.  
- Population models flop for outliers (insomniacs, etc.).

## How to Extend
- Add a real ML model (e.g., Python + scikit-learn) with synthetic PSG data.  
- Simulate breathing rate for apnea (like Apple Watch’s FDA trick).  
- Tweak thresholds for your device/user.

## Why This Matters
Wearables peddle “optimization,” but they’re pattern-matching gimmicks. This code peels back the curtain—great for skeptics, tinkerers, or anyone sick of sleep score hype. Fork it, break it, fix it.
